Plastics have a wide range of environmental impacts with leakage of macro plastics into the environments.

Reducing these impacts requires a comprehensive set of complementary policy instruments grouped into restraining demand, designing for circularity, enhancing recycling, closing leakage pathways and cleaning up.

HOW WE AIM TO ACHIEVE THIS:

- Through the block chain it'll be easy to track the number of recycled products.

- Rewards will be limited to 100 points, so payment won't be too large for company.

- For every 100 bottles , we pay 10 points as reward.

- Exchange rate for a given number of items is set by the parent company.

HOW VALUE IS GENERATED FOR PRODUCTS:

Exchange rate: 120
Number of bottles to recycle: 100
Equivalent Reward Point: 10
100 bottles = 10 points

Amount received = Reward Point / exchange rate.
Value received = 10รท120 = 0.083 Matic.
